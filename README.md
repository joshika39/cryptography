## File tree
The **rot** folder contains 2 shell scripts, the `rot13.sh` and `rot47.sh`. You can use them by starting the bash script and just type something. It will encrypt/decrypt it and if you have `xsel` tool it will copy the converted text to the clipboard as well.

The **rsa** folder contains the `rsa.py` script which is too complex for other users yet.
